# Timeline-of-Artificial-Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping cyber security at unprecedented speeds.  Understanding its historical milestones is interesting!.

**_Here is the Timeline of artificial intelligence._**

**The Early Rule-Based Era (1950–1970s)**
1950: 🧠 Alan Turing introduces the "Turing Test," suggesting machines could become indistinguishable from humans.

1956: 🎓 The Dartmouth Summer Research Project formalizes AI; John McCarthy coins the term "artificial intelligence."

1957: 🔢 Frank Rosenblatt develops the perceptron, laying the groundwork for machine learning.

1966: 🤖 Joseph Weizenbaum creates Eliza, the first chatbot simulating conversational psychology.
​

**❄️ First AI Winter (1970s–1980s)**
Funding and interest declined significantly after criticisms of early AI methodologies.
​

**🌱 Revival and Machine Learning Era (1980s–1990s)**
1986: 🔄 Jeffrey Hinton introduces back-propagation, enabling neural networks to learn from their own outputs.

1989: 📸 Yan LeCun develops LeNet, the influential convolutional neural network.
​

**❄️ Second AI Winter (Late 1980s–Mid 1990s)**
Further decline in funding and interest; skepticism towards AI grows.

**🚀 Renewed Interest and Major Breakthroughs (Late 1990s–2010)**
1997: ♟️ IBM’s Deep Blue defeats world chess champion Gary Kasparov.

1999: 🎮 Nvidia lthe GeForce GeForce 256 GPU, revolutionizing parallel processing.

2Geoffrey Jeffrey Hinton creates the first deep belief network, allowing AI to learn from large datasets independently.

2007: 🔥 Nvidia introduces CUDA architecture, drastically expanding GPU capabilities for general computing.
​

**📈 Deep Learning Explosion (2011–2020)**
2011: 📺 IBM's Watson wins Jeopardy; Apple launches Siri.

2012: 🧠 Google Braa breakthroughbreakthrough in unsupervised feature learning.

2013: 🎲 DeepMind’s DQN masters Atari games at superhuman levels.

2014: 🖼️ Introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for realistic image generation.

2015: 🖥️ Google deploys TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) optimized for machine learning.

2016: 🎯 DeepMind’s AlphaGo beats Go world champion 2017: 📖 Thel.

2017: 📖 "Attention is All You Need" paper introduces Transformer architecture, foundational to modern AI.

2018–2020: 🗣️ OpenAI’s GPT series rapidly evolves (GPT-1 to GPT-3), significantly enhancing natural language capabilities.
​

**🌐 AI in Mainstream Society (2021–Present)**

2021: 🖼️ OpenAI launches DALL-E for transformer-based image generation.

2022: 📈 Explosion of AI image generation tools (Midjourney, Stable Diffusion); ChatGPT released, becoming a global phenomenon.

2023: 🚀 GPT-4 released; Meta introduces open-source Llama models; Google launches Gemini.

2024: 🎥 OpenAI releases Sora for realistic AI video generation;GPT-01 are0 and GPT-01 introduced.

2025: 🖥️ Nvidia releases powerful Blackwell GPUs; further advancements with GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1, and Llama 4.
